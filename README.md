# JavaScript Password Generator

## Description:
I built this password generator to better understand how to reference properties within objects and then inject them into problem-appropriate math to produce the desired result. 

The general structure can be used to randomize any set of characters and make them fit your desired length, has some repurpose potential with slight alterations. 

### Concepts Learned/Solidified:
- Evolved from creating if-else soup to making comparatively more concise code. This has allowed me to construct a general framework for how I will approach problems going forward in order to make my code more readable as I move into larger projects.
- How to reference properties within an object and apply them.
- Math.floor and Math.random.
- How to use substring to cut off excess values by setting it up like so: (0, nameyname.length).
- How to set up a container for chosen values and put the values inside. 
## Usage:
Runs in browser, simply click the "Generate Password" button to initiate a series of window prompts/confirms that log how long you want your password to be/what character types should be included. Result is then displayed on the page.
